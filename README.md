# Basic Java for MSc Students

Hey there,

This repo is part of the Practices of Basic Java for the course in the MSc semester 2017-2018/2.

If you see any mistake or would like to collaborate with us, you are more than welcome to open issues and pull requests.

## Course rules
* Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it, we are not so cold hearted.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide case by case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you have 3 absences.

### Copies, plagiarism and similars
  Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood  or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction in the format of the university regulations.

### IDEs
  * IDEs are not allowed in class unless the lecturer authorizes
  * For any assignment, IDEs ARE FORBIDDEN unless the assignment description says the opposite

#### Course grades
* Challenges and class exercises (10%)
* Final assignment (40%)
* Exam (50%)

* Accepted pull requests can count as extra points in all the activities with grades, being that these points will never compose more than 30% of the grade.
  * The extra points will first be attributed to the challenges, then to the final assignment and only if all those are with full mark, to the final exam.

* During the exam period, the highest grade is taken
* There is no *cum laude* grade
